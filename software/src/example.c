// Example of a simple driver that uses a coop task.

// Coop tasks a cooperative non-preemtive tasks. In such a task you
// can use coop_task_yield() to yield back to other ticks or you can
// also use coop_task_sleep_ms(time). This will sleep for the specified
// time in ms in yield to other ticks in this time.
// Several coop tasks can be used in parallel.
