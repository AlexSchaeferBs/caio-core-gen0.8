// The main function of a Bricklet is usually just a bunch of *_init() calls
// and while-true loop with ticks.

// Usually there is one init and tick function per driver. Example: For a
// temperature sensor IC XXX there would usually be a xxx.c and xxx.h that
// implement a xxx_init and xxx_tick function. Additionally there will be
// a XXX struct that contains all the relevant values that may be used
// in the communication.c

// A tick can not do any busy-waiting or similar, it is supposed to return as fast
// as possible. 
// We do have cooperative, non-preemtive tasks. In these you can use a never-returning
// while-true loop. The example_tick uses such a coop-task.
